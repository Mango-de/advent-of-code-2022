# Advent of Code 2022

My solutions for Advent of Code 2022 (probably not all of them ;D)

Feel free to use [my script](create_files.py) to create all the necessary files, including your puzzle input. For that you need to install the dotenv module:

`pip install python-dotenv`

Look at [this file](.env.example), set the SESSION_TOKEN of https://adventofcode.com and change the name of the file to `.env`.

If you don't have the requests module, just download it via pip:

`pip install requests`
